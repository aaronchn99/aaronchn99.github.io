                <p class="mb-3">
                    The 20 Games Challenge is just as it says on the tin: Pick from a curated list of video games (the aim is 20 games, but they recommend to start with 10 games) and develop them using a chosen game engine.
                    Created by <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Matt_SDG_Games">@Matt_SDG_Games</a>, it aims to provide exposure to various video game mechanics and development tasks,
                    providing the opportunity to build the skills needed to develop your own video game.
                    To provide gradual progression, the challenge includes a 10 step program to choose and develop 10 games of increasing complexity and scope.
                    The full list of curated games and more can be found out <a class="link" href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/">here</a>.

                <h2 class="text-2xl mt-7 mb-3 font-bold">Why did I take part?</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Simple! I love video games and want to have a crack at making some popular games by myself.
                    Furthermore, it's also a great exercise to further build my software development skills, such as refactoring, building tools and automation of tasks.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl mt-7 mb-3 font-bold">Let's see the games!</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Enough talking! You can try out the games I've developed from the links in the sidebar on the left. These will lead you to pages that run the games on your browser.
                    No download necessary! Controls will be explained below the game panel. I also write a bit about what goes into developing these games if you are interested.
                </p>
