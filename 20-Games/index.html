                    The 20 Games Challenge is just as it says on the tin: Pick from a curated list of video games and develop them using the engine of your choice.
                    It aims to provide exposure to various video game mechanics and development tasks, giving you the opportunity to build the skills needed.
                    To provide gradual progression, the challenge also includes a 10 step program where you choose and develop 10 games of increasing complexity and scope.
                    The full list of curated games and more can be found out <a class="hover:underline font-bold" href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/">here</a>.

                <h2 class="text-2xl mt-7 mb-3 font-bold">Why did I take part?</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Simple! I love video games and want to have a crack at making some popular games by myself.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl mt-7 mb-3 font-bold">Let's see the games!</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Enough talking! You can try out the games I've developed from the links in the sidebar on the left. These will lead you to pages that run the games on your browser.
                    No download necessary! Controls will be explained below the game panel. I also write a bit about what goes into developing these games if you are interested.
