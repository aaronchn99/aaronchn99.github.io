<h3>Custom Editor</h3>
<p>
    One very powerful feature of Godot is their collection of prebuilt UI elements.
    This makes it quick and easy to build a level editor program that works specifically for my level format
    (Fun Fact: This is why the Godot editor itself runs on the Godot engine. Inception!)
</p>
<div class="grid grid-flow-col grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <img class="basis" src="{{< absURL "img/breakout-editor.png" >}}" />
    <div>
        <p>
            The editor reuses the walls used in game and presents a grid where the
            bricks would be placed in game. Each square is clickable, and the brick type
            and colour can be changed. The size of the grid can be changed and levels
            can be created or deleted. Once done, the levels can be saved and it's immediately
            ready to be played.
        </p>
        <p>
            This proved to be very useful for level design, as levels can be visualised
            and changes can be quickly made with less hassle, saving time.
