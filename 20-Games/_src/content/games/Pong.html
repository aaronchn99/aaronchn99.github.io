    A simple single player paddle game, based on the early Pong games in the 1970s.
    Move your paddle up or down to return the ball to the AI opponent, aim to shoot the ball past the opponent's paddle, first to 10 points win.

    My first game developed using Godot, where I leveraged my experience with Unity to get familiar with the game engine.
    In implementing the opponent, I experimented with different AI techniques, tweaking with various handicap techniques so to give the player a chance.
