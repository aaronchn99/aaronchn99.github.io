      <description>Breakout Play Breakout&#xD;Controls Move Left - Left/A key&#xA;Move Right - Right/D key&#xA;More Info Custom Editor One very powerful feature of Godot is their collection of prebuilt UI elements. This makes it quick and easy to build a level editor program that works specifically for my level format (Fun Fact: This is why the Godot editor itself runs on the Godot engine. Inception!) The editor reuses the walls used in game and presents a grid where the bricks would be placed in game.</description>

      <description>Pong Play Pong&#xD;Controls Move Paddle Up - Up/W key&#xA;Move Paddle Down - Down/S key&#xA;More Info A simple single player paddle game, based on the early Pong games in the 1970s. Move your paddle up or down to return the ball to the AI opponent, aim to shoot the ball past the opponent&#39;s paddle, first to 10 points wins. My first game developed using Godot, where I leveraged my experience with Unity to get familiar with the game engine.</description>
